For multivariable problems, rather than creating a Python array of stochastic variables, addressing the size keyword in the call to a Stochastic variable creates multivariate array of (independent) stochastic variables. The array behaves like a Numpy array when used like one, and references to its value attribute return Numpy arrays.
The size argument also solves the annoying case where you may have many variables Î²i,i=1,...,N you wish to model. Instead of creating arbitrary names and variables for each one, like:
```
beta_1 = mc.Uniform("beta_1", 0, 1)
beta_2 = mc.Uniform("beta_2", 0, 1)
...
```
we can instead wrap them into a single variable:
```
betas = mc.Uniform("betas", 0, 1, size=N)
```

Warning: Don't update stochastic variables' values in-place.
Stochastic objects' values should not be updated in-place. This confuses PyMC's caching scheme... The only way a stochastic variable's value should be updated is using statements of the following form:
    ```
    A.value = new_value
    ```
The following are in-place updates and should never be used:
    ```
    A.value += 3
    A.value[2,1] = 5
    A.value.attribute = new_attribute_value
    ```
